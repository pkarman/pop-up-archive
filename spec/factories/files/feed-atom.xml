Back in the '90s, Columbia House was known for its "eight CDs a penny" slogan. </p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">I’m pretty sure I signed up every person in my family once so that I could get eight CDs for a penny, four times. I believe the CDs were $25 a piece, which would mean I got eight CDs for $25.01, four times. That means I got 32 CDs for $100.04, which comes out to $3.13 per CD. Not a great business plan, Columbia House. Here are all 32 of the CDs. Don’t ask me why I remember this. I was pretty obsessed.</span></p>

In the following decade, the city has transformed its public schools, housing and business community. Marketplace Morning Report host David Brancaccio traveled to the city to <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/10-years-after-katrina/how-independent-businesses-kept-new-orleans-afloat" target="_blank">explore</a> what these vast changes mean for New Orleans and the country. </em></strong></p>
<hr /><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">If you wanted a stuffed pepper in New Orleans, the place to get that pepper for generations of New Orleanians was an urban grocery store in the city's Seventh Ward called <a href="http://www.circlefoodsnola.com/" target="_blank">Circle Food Store</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">"We have the cheapest green bell peppers in the city," says Brooke Boudreaux, director of marketing at Circle Food and daughter of owner Dwayne Boudreaux. "A lot of people come in and they're upset that it's no longer five for a dollar, but it has been 10 years." Flooded and destroyed by Katrina, Circle Food lay fallow for most of the past decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">"The initial surge was about nine feet, of course [we] lost all of our inventory and, not to mention, most of the neighborhood was devastated," Boudreaux <span>says</span>. "After Katrina, it wasn't a question, 'Are we going to come back?' It was, 'Is there anything to come back to?'" </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">The store did reopen, <a href="http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2014/01/circle_food_store_opens_again.html" target="_blank">eight and half years later</a>, in January of 2014. Though the business had insurance and some means, rebuilding was slow and came with hurdles. </span></p>
<p>"We are talking about a building that is over 100 years old. Every time we tried to build, we found new things, new issues, new problems," Boudreaux says. "There were big companies that would come and say, 'We'll just take this off your hands.'" She and her mother urged her father not to sell. </p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">"We [had] people calling us from Texas saying, 'If the store reopens, we're coming back to our neighborhood,'" she says. After reopening, the store hired back over 60 original staff members. But Boudreaux also is looking ahead. </span></p>
<p>"People are different. Now people want organic things, and people want stuff that we would never even consider selling before," says Boudreaux, who now stocks quinoa on the shelves of her family's store. "We gotta think about the future, because that's where we're going to be. Thinking about the past constantly, it'll keep you down and you gotta keep moving forward."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Greece has agreed a bailout deal "in principle" with its creditors, the European Commission has said.</p>
<p>The Commission said a technical agreement had been reached with Greece, which now requires political approval.</p>
<p>Earlier, Greece's Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos had said "two or three small issues," were yet to be resolved with lenders, following overnight talks in Athens.</p>
<p>A deal is needed to keep the country in the eurozone and avert bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Greek government is hoping to push a new €86bn (£60bn) three-year agreement through parliament later this week.</p>
<p>The country needs a deal by 20 August, when it has a debt repayment of about €3bn to make to the European Central Bank.</p>
<p><strong>Greek bailout deal - some key points*</strong></p>
<p><span> — </span>Phasing out early retirement and gradual increase of pension age to 67 by 2022</p>
<p><span> — </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Agreement to recapitalise banks and manage non-performing loans</span></p>
<p><span> — </span>Deal on primary surplus targets: 0.25 percent deficit for 2015, 0.5 percent surplus in 2016, 1.75 percent in 2017 and 3.5 percent in 2018</p>

They've averaged about half the growth of the decade before the recession. There are two theories as to why, and depending on which one prevails at the Federal Reserve, productivity numbers could bolster the case for or against an interest rate hike. </p>
<p>The previous two quarters, which were both negative, raised concerns about a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/us-economy-productivity-idUSKBN0OK1FB20150604" target="_blank">potential ramp-up in inflation</a>. Productivity<span style="line-height: 1.42em;"> sluggishness comes amid two other key factors: <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/07/us-companies-may-be-hiring-but-lid-on-wages-investment-hits-productivity.html" target="_blank">wage growth that is barely outpacing inflation and a falling unemployment rate</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42em;">That's an unusual set of circumstances, says Tom Kochan, an employment researcher at MIT. "</span><span style="line-height: 1.42em;">There's a lot of room for productivity growth," Kochan says. "But it requires a business strategy that says, 'Let's invest.'"</span></p>
<p>And so, the first theory as to what's holding back productivity is the lack of such investment on things like new factories and equipment. Productivity growth suffers if workers are stuck with old tools. The good news, says Kochan, is that such investment may be picking up, which would bolster the argument to keep interest rates low to encourage that growth. </p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42em;">But the second theory argues that the current state of things is the new normal, says Josh Bivens, the research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute. </span><span style="line-height: 1.42em;">The case for that, he says, is that "there did seem to be deceleration of productivity growth even before the Great Recession hit."</span></p>
<p>Bivens says if the Federal Reserve agrees with the "new normal" theory, it could raise interest rates quicker. But, if the "business investment" theory prevails, to which he also subscribes, "It's just one more problem that will be solved by getting the economy back to full health. The best way to ensure it gets back to full health is to keep interest rates low."</p>

<p>That's how much China's central bank devalued its currency against the dollar on Tuesday. It's the largest devaluation of the renminbi since 1994, when the current system was put into place. As the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/business/international/china-lowers-value-of-its-currency-as-economic-slowdown-raises-concerns.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> reports, the abrupt move will be a difficult one for the Obama administration; Congress has raised concerns that China's general undervaluing of its currency has been aimed at bolstering industry at the expense of jobs in the U.S.</p>

<p>Speaking of China, that's how many songs <span>—</span> mostly rap, hip-hop and rhythm and blues <span>—</span> have been banned by the Chinese government. The Ministry of Culture sent a note late Monday night asking streaming music services to remove these songs. But as <a href="http://qz.com/476668/chinas-latest-baffling-crackdown-vulgar-rap-music/" target="_blank">Quartz</a> writes, the labeling of the material as obscene may only have piqued interest.</p>

<p>That's how long it took Circle Foods Store, a family owned grocery store in the Seventh Ward of New Orleans, to reopen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Brooke Boudreaux, director of marketing at Circle Food and daughter of owner Dwayne Boudreaux, says the building is over 100 years old and problems kept popping up as they assessed the damage. <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/10-years-after-katrina/story-new-orleans-recovery-one-business" target="_blank">But reopen it did</a>.

But why would anyone want to tinker with the structure of a company as successful as Google?</p>
<p>“What Alphabet is thinking here is to essentially streamline things,” says <span style="line-height: 19.9999809265137px;">Molly Wood.</span><span style="line-height: 19.9999809265137px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">But fear not, “Google the search engine, and Mail Company, and information gatherer will stay the same,” she says.</span></p>
<p>The decision behind this restructuring is that making money off of being a search engine can’t sustain a company forever. “It’s more a reflection that it can’t keep growing like a rocket ship,” Wood explains.</p>
<p>This move allows Google to be more focused. “Investors, and I think even employees at Google, had been calling for focus for a while. The company is really at risk of being distracted by all the things Larry Page and Sergey Brin want to do,” Wood says.</p>
<p>Wood explains that “investors are excited at the prospect of a more focused Google that could keep making them more money. And the possibility that Larry and Sergey, unleashed, might come across the next really, truly transformative money maker.”</p>

<p>The most common laugh is "haha," <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">followed by various emoji and "hehe." </span></p>
<p>Age and gender play a role. <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Young people and women prefer emoji, whereas men prefer longer "hehes." </span></p>

To a lot of people, he was probably better known as a member of the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/mnf" target="_blank">Monday Night Football</a> crew through the 1970s and '80s, and most of the '90s. Or even as Kathie Lee Gifford's husband. He<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"> played for the NFL before football became the national sport, </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">back when boxing was a Friday-night fixture on network TV and college football was more popular than the pros.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">But maybe more than anyone in the history of the game, Gifford's career is something of a timeline for what football has become in America. </span></p>
<p>Let's <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">start with a little context. Last year’s No. 1 draft pick, Jadeveon Clowney, signed a contract with the Houston Texans for more than $22 million a year and got $14 million just for signing. Frank Gifford was the No. 1 pick of the New York Giants in 1952 and played for $8,000 a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">"And h</span>e signed for a $250 signing bonus,” says Jackson Michael, author of the book, "<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"><a href="http://www.thegamebeforethemoney.com/" target="_blank">The Game Before the Money: Voices of the Men Who Built the NFL</a>." </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Gifford was the son of an oil-field worker who got a scholarship to USC and became a star for the Trojans. But when he got to the NFL, more people were interested in baseball than pro football.</span></p>
<p>“The league wasn’t as popular back then in 1952," Michael says. "Television really helped increase pro football’s popularity.”</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">And when Gifford retired, TV was waiting. "The broadcasters were like, 'W</span>e need an NFL guy,” says T.J. Troup, a former player and coach who's written a couple of books on the NFL. He says hiring Gifford in the early 1960s to help broadcast was a no brainer. "If you were a Giant in Manhattan and playing well, why not make the transition if you can?"<strong style="line-height: 1.42857em;"><br /></strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Gifford joined Monday Night Football in 1971, its second season. In his 26 years, the broadcast went from strictly X's and O's to a celebrity culture all its own — and so did football. Today’s game is as much about theater as it is about winners and losers. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">"It's much more about entertainment," Michael says. "It's made for television."</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Which translates into big bucks for owners and teams. One estimate has the league’s TV revenue alone topping $6 billion next year.</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"> </span></p>

The plan itself isn’t cheap, with its $350 billion price tag. Like some of her rivals for the Democratic ticket, Clinton wants to make college “debt free” for more students.  </p>
<p><span>Student loans are shaping up to be a central issue in this presidential campaign. </span>Americans collectively owe more than $1 trillion in student loans, says Mark Huelsman with the think tank Demos, and a lot of them will be voting.</p>
<p>“The generation that’s really coming of age politically, the millennial generation, is the generation that has had to borrow the most, and for whom student debt really is the most acute crisis they’re probably facing, economically,” he says.</p>
<p>So what does "debt-free" actually mean? U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/make-college-tuition-free" target="_blank">has proposed</a> eliminating tuition at public universities. The Clinton plan would give federal funding to states that make community college tuition-free and offer a no-loan option at four-year colleges. Under both proposals, low-income students would be able to use federal Pell grants to pay for living expenses. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley <a href="https://martinomalley.com/the-latest/op-ed/debt-free-college/" target="_blank">has also proposed</a> making public colleges tuition-free within five years. </p>

Here&#039;s why.]]></summary><author><name>Sabri Ben-Achour</name></author><content type="application/xml"><fields xmlns="http://dezi.org/sos/schema"><nid>153020</nid><body><![CDATA[<p>Warren Buffett and his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway will buy the manufacturing supplier Precision Castparts Corp., which makes the metal pieces that go into turbines and aircraft engines. Price tag: $32 billion.</p>
<p>It's Berkshire's biggest deal to date, and it comes during a very busy year for mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>“By the time the dust settles, it may even be the largest ever,” says Anant Sundaram, professor of finance at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for all the merger and acquisition mania, and they all help paint a picture of what’s happening in corporate America.</p>
<p>First, firms often borrow money to help them buy other companies, and interest rates have been and remain very low.</p>
<p>“Now the CEO’s of some of these acquirers are starting to look at the Federal Reserve and say, 'You know what, the end is in sight,'” says David Nelson, chief strategist at Belpointe. "It’s likely that over the next couple years, interest rates are going to climb.... <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">T</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">he era of cheap money may start to go away, and it's going to be far more difficult for these firms to get these deals done. So they’re doing them now.”</span></p>
<p>Second, global growth is tepid, especially for firms with a lot of exposure to a slowing China, for example.</p>
<p>“Growth is harder to come by,” explains Bill Caffee, partner at White Summers Caffee James in Portland, Oregon. “It is easier to buy growth than it is to create it, and mergers and acquisition is one typical way. It’s easier to get economies of scale, you can get more bargaining power, costs go down and market share goes up.”</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">A lot of this is industry specific, says Caffee — some industries are undergoing significant disruption, and consolidation is being driven by competition. But on the whole, it may signify that many firms expect low growth in the near future.</span></p>
<p>Third, many companies have large piles of cash they’ve accumulated. And their shares are highly valued. CEO’s say to themselves “I feel wealthy so I’ll go shopping for big-ticket items,” Sundaram says. The flipside, he adds, is that if everyone’s shares are highly valued, there’s a risk you’re overpaying for whatever company is being purchased.</p>
<p>Finally, there's a somewhat psychological reason, says Sundaram. “There’s a lot of what we call looking-over-the-shoulder kind of behavior amongst CFOs and CEOs. In other words, herding behavior.” Should decisions go wrong, “it’s easier to fail in a crowd than it is to fail alone.”</p>

Around 900 families lived there before the flooding from Hurricane Katrina. Some former residents remember St. Bernard as a community where people worked hard and looked out for each other. Others, including many New Orleans residents who did not live in the project, say St. Bernard was violent and impoverished.</p>
<p>The New Orleans City Council voted in 2007 to demolish St. Bernard. The question was: What would replace it?</p>
<p>After Hurricane Katrina, a group of New Orleans business and community leaders formed a nonprofit organization called the <a href="http://www.bayoudistrictfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Bayou District Foundation</a>. The group's stated mission is to implement community redevelopment models. It set its sights on redeveloping St. Bernard. The foundation took its cues from <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/east-lake-success-a-model-for-other-troubled-areas/nSS4Q/" target="_blank">East Lake in Atlanta</a>, a mixed-income community that replaced a housing project so violent, it had earned the nickname "Little Vietnam." These days, East Lake is known as an Atlanta success story.</p>
<p>The development that replaced St. Bernard is called Columbia Parc at the Bayou District, and is widely known simply as Columbia Parc. </p>
<p>It boasts amenities like a fitness center, a movie theater, a swimming pool, large playing fields and beautiful homes. The streets outside of the development are rough with potholes.  The streets are glassy-smooth in Columbia Parc.</p>
<p>Residents' children are offered free classes through Educare, a program that aims to prepare low-income children for school.</p>
<p>"[Educare,] to me, is the crown jewel of the whole development," says J.T. Hannan, director of public affairs for the Bayou District Foundation.</p>

<p>"This is our way of assaulting multigenerational poverty. Children who come from low-income families typically receive no preschool. They start behind, they stay behind." </p>
<p>Not children at Columbia Parc, which has a cradle to college education model and is currently gearing up for the construction of a K -8 school. <strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>There are three types of renters at Columbia Parc. One-third are public housing tenants, who pay a third of their income, no matter what it is, in rent.</p>
<p>Another third, also low-income, pay a fixed amount that is below market rate. The final group have middle class jobs — police officers and professors — and pay market rate. The development also has some senior housing.</p>
<p>Proponents of mixed-income developments say research shows that if low-income people live alongside middle- and upper-income neighbors, they achieve greater economic mobility. Hannan stresses that Columbia Parc residents, regardless of income, are treated equally. </p>
<p>"Everybody is on the same lease," he says. "Whether you make over six figures or you're completely dependent on public subsidy. Every resident needs to adhere to three conditions."</p>
<p>Those are: Adult residents must work at least 20 hours a week and have to pass a credit check. They must have a record that has been clean of felony convictions for at least seven years.</p>
<p>This means that some people, including some displaced former St. Bernard residents, can't live in Columbia Parc. </p>
<p>Robert Lewis, 42, is one of those people. He still lives nearby and sometimes cuts through Columbia Parc on his bike to get to a nearby store. He was raised in the St. Bernard project and is angry that it was demolished.</p>
<p>"It's messed up now that they tore it down and rebuilt it,” Lewis says. "And everybody that was living back here, ain't back here. They're all over." </p>
<p>Lewis' complaint cuts to the heart of what happened after St. Bernard was inundated:  Some residents <em>did not</em> return. Some residents<em> could not</em> return.</p>
<p>Lewis, who has a felony drug conviction, is one of those who can't live here. He visits friends in Columbia Parc sometimes but he says he wouldn't want to live here.</p>
<p>It's too quiet, he says, too sterile. No one barbecues, no one hangs out. It's not a community, like St. Bernard was. </p>
<p>Lewis is not alone in this view. For all of its critics, some of St. Bernard's fiercest defenders are people who once lived there.  </p>
<p><a href="http://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/lawrence-vale" target="_blank">Lawrence Vale,</a> a professor of urban design and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo14941776.html" target="_blank">has spent time interviewing residents</a> of housing projects in cities across the country.</p>
<p>He says many express frustration that outsiders view projects only as impoverished and crime-ridden places.</p>
<p>"They hear everyone talking about 'Oh, you live in concentrated poverty', but they don't hear anybody saying, 'Oh, how lucky, you live in a place of concentrated affordability,' or without getting too romantic about it, concentrated community," Vale says. </p>
<p>Lewis will admit to liking one thing about the neighborhood improvements that Columbia Parc has engendered: <a href="http://www.parisitediy.org/" target="_blank">a little skate park </a>that was built under Interstate 610 where, he says, all the neighborhood kids hang out.</p>
<div class="image-right"><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><img alt="A scale model of the Columbia Parc development in New Orleans." height="265" width="400" class="media-element file-default lazy" typeof="foaf:Image" data-src="http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/houses_1.jpg" src="/sites/default/themes/marketplacev2Responsive/images/pixel.gif" title="" /><div class="field field-name-field-description field-type-text-long field-label-hidden multi-value-field"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item first even"><p><em>A scale model of the Columbia Parc development in New Orleans.</em></p>

<p>Jerome Lipscomb, 18, was headed to the skate park on a recent day. He lives in Columbia Parc with his grandmother. Like Lewis, he lived in St. Bernard before the flood, and like Lewis, he has some great memories of his time there. He remembers waking up on summer days and playing outside with his friends. Lipscomb says he resents St. Bernard's demolition.</p>
<p>"That's where I was born and raised," Lipscomb says. "It was tragic. But I had to get over it. Life had to go on. [Columbia Parc] is quiet. It's cleaner. But I prefer the old St. Bernard."</p>
<p>Like many young people his age, Lipscomb is thinking a lot about what he'll do after graduating from high school. He reels off a list of instruments that he plays in church and school: snare drum, bass drum, saxophone. He even picks up a little money playing in the French Quarter. He also plays baseball and is eyeing an athletic scholarship. </p>
<p>When asked to consider whether growing up in Columbia Parc will offer him a better life in the long run, Lipscomb says he thinks it will. He says, he was able to go<a href="http://www.newbeginningsnola.net/m/news/show_news.jsp?REC_ID=283470&amp;id=0" target="_blank"> on a college tour</a> to the Naval Academy in Baltimore, which has partnered with the Bayou District Foundation. That wouldn't have been an option at St. Bernard. And he says he has a mentor at Columbia Parc, a man named Terrell Haynes, who makes sure he stays on the straight and narrow.</p>
<p>Haynes is a social worker with a nonprofit called <a href="https://www.google.com/url?url=http://www.kingsleyhouse.org/&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwjFxKqFspXHAhUMFJIKHWtYAE4&amp;sig2=o96PyTTq1rt7hDQLM_xXZw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJlVKoDpjVwvHcIAGYxEipVEHQ3Q" target="_blank">Kingsley House.</a> He works on site at Columbia Parc, providing counseling to anyone who needs it, and he is astonished to learn that Jerome thinks of him as a mentor. He appreciates the young man's compliment and says, that, in a nutshell is the argument for a mixed-income development. </p>
<p>"Growing up in St. Bernard, if you didn't have a strong-knit family providing structure, you could easily succumb to the underground, criminal activity for lack of a better word," Haynes says. "Him growing up in this environment, him being able to reach me - I mean, he has my cell phone number."</p>
<p>Haynes, who is 47, remembers St. Bernard as a troubled place. He recalls dropping his high school teammates off in the evening and being urged, "Don't stop at the red light. Just keep going."</p>
<p>He has great expectations for the young man who spoke offhandedly of his musical and athletic abilities. He says Jerome has something more than ability: He has talent.</p>
<p>"If he's not playing in the major leagues, he's probably gonna be playing an instrument," Haynes says, when asked what he sees in Jerome's future. "I can see him being along the lines of a Wynton Marsalis or a Harry Connick  Jr. I mean, the guy is just that good. He's just that good."</p>
<p>Haynes kept in touch with some those old high school teammates who lived in St. Bernard. A few of them did very well. One played professional football.</p>
<p>But, he says, those guys were really the exception. If Columbia Parc's model works, he says success for everyone (or at least, everyone who is lucky enough to live here) will be the rule.</p>

This is bad news for the soda industry. The New York Times’ Anahad O’Connor reports on how Coca Cola has gained influence in obesity research.</p>
<p>Coca Cola is a funder of the Global Energy Balance Network, whose researchers' “goal is to increase awareness of the energy balance equation.” They believe that “people are not focused enough on physical activity, because they believe sedentary behavior is a huge driver of obesity,” O’Connor explains.  </p>
<p>So … does this mean the group is recommending we drink as much soda as we want? <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Not quite, but O’Connor says that “they say that the way to maintain a healthy, stable body weight is not reducing calorie and food intake, as many public health experts would argue, but is to actually eat more and exercise more.”</span></p>
<p>This funding by Coca Cola comes at a time when soda sales are declining. “The food industry is scrambling. They see the writing on the wall,” O’Connor says.</p>
<p>The critics of this research think of the Global Energy Balance Network as more of an advocacy group for Coca Cola. “When I reached out to several independent obesity experts who don’t take food industry funding, they all said the same thing," <span style="line-height: 19.9999809265137px;">O’Connor explains. "I</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">n their words, they said, ‘This is a front group for Coca Cola.’”</span></p>

Renee Dua is the mother of the invention.]]></summary><author><name>Kai Ryssdal</name></author><content type="application/xml"><fields xmlns="http://dezi.org/sos/schema"><nid>153026</nid><body><![CDATA[<p>In this on-demand economy, there’s an app for pretty much anything. Do you want Thai food? Done. Need a ride to the airport? A car will be at your place in 10 minutes. Want a custom-tailored shirt? Yes, there’s an app for that too. So why wait for a doctor?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/drreneedua" target="_blank">Dr. Renee Dua</a> is trying to change the way we approach doctor visits. We visited her office in Santa Monica and asked her how she went from being a nephrologist to running a tech company called <a href="https://getheal.com/" target="_blank">Heal</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O_ucC7hACx0?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>“One night, we were taking my boy to the emergency room. After about eight hours, we finally saw an attending physician. She just looked at me and said, ‘There’s nothing wrong with your son. Go home.’ It was midnight, and I was furious,” Dua says. She turned to her husband and said, “We’ve got to come up with a better way to do this.” That’s where the idea for Heal was born.</p>
<p>For $99, Heal will send a doctor and a nurse to your house in 60 minutes. They arrive with electronic records and a little black doctor’s bag full of high-tech tools like an otoscope — used to look in the ears — that hooks up to an iPhone. Heal’s doctors can’t perform complex procedures yet, but they can take on the kinds of complaints that bring many people into their primary care doctors’ offices, like diagnosing and treating ailments, writing prescriptions, stitching up cuts and even giving ultrasounds. The company does not yet accept insurance but plans to in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xVNf1w8tr0?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Heal has a mix of full-time and part-time doctors. “It’s very expensive to be a doctor in private practice, and to be frank, it doesn’t really exist anymore. Now, when doctors graduate, they don’t know how to run a business,” Dua says. "It’s very appealing to doctors to come and work with us full time, because they don’t have any overhead. We handle all of the expenses. We deal with billing, and their job is to see patients, which is why they became doctors in the first place.”</p>
<p>The company launched in February in Los Angeles and has recently expanded to San Francisco. It’s set to roll out in another 15 major cities this year. “California is a very difficult state to do anything in," <span>Dua says. "</span>After you’ve conquered California, the sky’s the limit.”</p>

By that measure, the housing market looks pretty good, but the prices are being driven by a severe lack of supply. And that’s discouraging for many buyers, especially in some of the hottest markets, like Denver.</p>
<p>Take the case of new mom Robin Smith. Her apartment in Denver was too small for her growing family. So Smith and her husband went looking for a house. They found one in the suburbs they really liked, a four-bedroom place listed for $259,000.</p>
<p>“We made an offer $10,000 over the asking price,” says Smith as she bounces her baby on her lap. “There were 32 offers on the home over a weekend.”</p>
<p>In the end, her $10,000 over asking price wasn’t even close. It sold for $282,000.</p>
<p>Smith and her husband both work for national companies, which makes relocating easier. So they considered something a little radical: They decided to expand their housing search to Texas.</p>
<p>“Someone recommended Austin<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"> and said it was a little more affordable and still a great place to live," <span>Smith</span><span> recalls</span>. "So we actually booked a flight the following week and bought a house.”</span></p>
<p>The median price for a single family home in Austin is about $50,000 cheaper than in Denver. But many people don’t have the luxury of moving to a more affordable area.</p>
<p>The problem from Seattle to Dallas to Denver is that buyers are bidding up a very limited supply of homes.</p>
<p>“Prices are rising just too fast,” says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors. “And certainly far ahead of people’s income.”</p>
<p>The supply shortage is a problem for all types of housing for sale. Condos account for just 5.5 percent of all multifamily building in the first quarter of 2015 — that’s the lowest level since the Commerce Department began keeping track of that 41 years ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, single family home construction is half of what it should be, according to Bob Denk with the National Association of Home Builders. Denk says changing that would require a seismic shift in the industry. That’s because skilled labor and lots to build on are in short supply.</p>
<p>“And we are having these supply chain headwinds,” Denk<span style="line-height: 19.9999809265137px;"> says.</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"> “It’s hard to just double overnight. But the other part of that is we have produced at this level before, so it’s not impossible.”</span></p>
<p>Not impossible, but probably not changing anytime soon. Which means home prices will likely keep going up.</p>

But he says “back-to-school sales can fluctuate quite a bit” because of popular clothing trends among teens or hot new electronic items like tablet computers.</p>
<p>And this year, Price says, there are no must-have gadgets on schoolkids’ to-buy lists, so he predicts a modest back-to-school season. That’s consistent with survey results from the <a href="https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/after-splurging-2014-families-trim-back-school-spending-2015" target="_blank">National Retail Federation</a>, which estimates that the average family will spend $630 — about 5 percent less than last year — on school supplies, clothes and electronics.</p>
<p>At least 17 states hold <a href="http://www.salestaxinstitute.com/resources/sales-tax-holidays" target="_blank">sales-tax holidays</a> for back-to-school-related purchases throughout the month of August, including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. They range from one or two days to more than one week in length and would save the typical family in a state with a tax rate of 7 percent about $44. Some states have tax holidays for other items, such as hurricane and emergency supplies, energy-efficient appliances and firearms.</p>
<p>But while tax holidays leave holes in state budgets, they don’t necessarily boost net sales for local businesses, says tax expert Kay Bell at Bankrate.com.</p>
<p>“I think it tends to shift shopping patterns more than increases them,” Bell says. “People just put off their shopping, they know this is coming up, they have their list, but they’re not going to go until they can save a few tax dollars.”</p>

<hr>

<br>Panera and Starbucks are fine, but<a href="http://laurelstreetbakery.com/" target="_blank"> Laurel Street Bakery</a> is something different. Hillary Guttman, the proprietor, recalls no chain coffee places opening near her in the weeks that followed the flood. First responders were a hungry market themselves.</br>

<br>“Just the National Guard alone could have kept me open," Guttman <span>says</span>. "There was no place to eat, there was no place to get groceries and people were tired of eating [rations]."&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Guttman was able to line up supplies from Baton Rouge, 80 miles away. Six weeks later, once the evacuation order was lifted and she got the all-clear on her water supply, she reopened, even before electricity was restored.</br>

<br>“I would mix by hand; I could only do things that I could make by hand, which is a lot actually," she says. "It’s how it used to be all be done.”&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Indie businesses like this had a strong track record finding ways to reopen.&nbsp;</br>


<br>“They don’t really have any options;&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">there is no safer place for them to retreat to," says Dana Eness, who runs a nonprofit in the city called </span><a style="line-height: 1.42857em;" href="http://www.staylocal.org/about/people/dana-eness" target="_blank">Stay Local</a><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">.&nbsp;"They can’t go up to headquarters, pull back.”&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">These indies, Eness says, have been an engine these last 10 years, not only because tourists gravitate to cool places, but data show that indies tend to source from nearby.</br>

<br>“[They] hire someone locally to do the designing, the branding, the social media. So [they're]&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">creating lots and lots of local jobs for other local businesses," Eness <span>says</span>.&nbsp;</br>

<br>As you stand on Magazine Street in New Orleans, a commercial corridor filled with retail shops, it's hard to spot many recognizable brands. Roberta Brandes Gratz, an urban planning expert and author of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Were-Still-Here-Ya-Bastards/dp/1568587449" target="_blank">We're Still Here Ya Bastards: How the People of New Orleans Rebuilt Their City</a>," says this comes from under- rather than over-planning.</br>

<br>"It's a miracle in its own way," Gratz <span>says</span>. "Not planned on any planning board, just sort of emerged organically, a mixture of small business, local ones, big ones and some chains."&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">For such a dense commercial strip, planners didn't push suburban-style parking lots and shoppers make do with the street parking or walk.</br>

<br>Quentin Messer, CEO of the <a href="http://www.nolaba.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank">New Orleans Business Alliance</a>, is a fan of the indie businesses that give New Orleans its resilience and character, but he's also working to attract national retail brands at the same time.</br>

<br>“New Orleans was significantly under-retailed, about 30 percent under-retailed," says Messer of pre-Katrina New Orleans, "so you had the city losing tax revenue" to regions outside the city that had the national chains.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">A new challenge is that indie businesses are seeing their rents rise. They blame the nationals coming in, sometimes lured with tax breaks, bidding up their leases.</br>

<br>But in many parts of post-Katrina New Orleans, national chains are nowhere to be seen. On the corner of Bayou Road and Desoto Street in the city's Seventh Ward, Vera Warren-Williams, founder of the <a href="Community%20Book%20Center" target="_blank">Community Book Center</a>, was part of a group of women who ran businesses along the block.</br>

<br>“We became known as the belles of Bayou Road," Warren-Williams <span>says</span>. After the disaster, her bookstore along with the hair salon, day care center and restaurant next door got back in business with a common land line, a copy machine and even shared labor.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">“We pooled our resources together, and we supported each other, we encourage each other to just come back and continue to develop.”</br>

<br>Before your hearts get over-warmed, here’s a dose of post-Katrina retail reality: Although the storm thought otherwise, this area wasn’t a flood zone, and the store had no flood insurance. When Warren-Williams scraped together the money to fix the ruined floor, a careless workman left the water on, destroying the repair. She paid upfront to fix the shattered windows, but those contractors vanished. Weeks later, she tracked them down.</br>

<br>“I was able to remind them who I was and escort them to the bank and got my money and was done," Warren-Williams says.</br>

<br>Her challenge 10 years later is digital. We all know what Amazon and e-readers are doing to booksellers. In other words, the national competition didn’t move in next door. They slid in via the internet. Warren-Williams is adapting by selling more gifts and Senegalese cloth set out in neat piles amid the bookshelves.</br>

<p>That's the value (including debt) of <span style="line-height: 19.9999809265137px;">Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"> deal to purchase Precision Castparts Corp., announced Monday. It will be the largest acquisition overseen by Warren Buffet, Berkshire chairman and CEO. As the </span><a style="line-height: 1.42857em;" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-to-buy-precision-castparts-1439205293" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;"> reports, the move highlights how the company has lately drawn much of its earnings from buying other companies as opposed to investment.</span></p>
<div class="large blue awesome">10 years</div>
<p>It has been that long <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/independent-businesses-keep-new-orleans-afloat" target="_blank">since Hurricane Katrina</a> devastated New Orleans. The Marketplace Morning Report team headed down south to check in on how the city has been recovering. What they found was a host of small business owners who prided themselves on reopening and serving the community as quickly as they could following the flood. </p>
<div class="large blue awesome">15 months</div>
<p>That's how long a crop of red lettuce has been growing aboard the International Space Station. Grown using an LED light system, the vegetable will soon become the first space-harvested food to be eaten by astronauts. As <a href="http://qz.com/475471/astronauts-are-about-to-eat-the-first-food-grown-in-space/" target="_blank">Quartz</a> writes, half the lettuce will be cleaned with <span>citric-acid-based sanitizing wipes, while the other half will be brought back to earth for study.</span></p>
<div class="large blue awesome">5.5 percent</div>
<p>That's how much condos account for in <span>all multifamily building in the first quarter of 2015, the lowest its been in the 41 years the Commerce Department has tracked this specific corner of the housing market. But it's not just condos that are lacking in supply. The housing market, while on the rise for the past couple of years, has been largely influenced by a growing demand amidst a lack of supply. That means <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/denver-markus" target="_blank">home prices that are outpacing the income of buyers</a>.</span></p>
<div class="large blue awesome">$44</div>
<p>That's how much a family in a state with a 7 percent sales tax could save with a sales-tax holiday for back-to-school purchases. Analysts are predicting <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/education/back-school-hartman" target="_blank">modest back-to-school sales</a>, as there are not many must-have gadgets for the fall. In fact, the average family is expected to spend 5 percent less this year than last on school supplies.</p>

]]></summary><author><name>Gigi Douban</name></author><content type="application/xml"><fields xmlns="http://dezi.org/sos/schema"><nid>152996</nid><body><![CDATA[<p>Hertz reported lower earnings this week. The company has been struggling, and shares are down more than a third from a year ago. But overall the car rental industry is at a high point. Revenue is at about $38 billion a year. Amid competition from car-sharing services, is Hertz capitalizing on its profit-making potential?</p>
<p>Getting the extra insurance coverage or having the company put gas in the car for you? Not cheap. But this is how car rental companies make money. Just ask Bill Carroll, who taught marketing at Cornell University and worked for Hertz for 17 years.</p>
<p>"Pretty high margin return on that," he says.</p>
<p>Then there's the other car rental bread and butter: the business traveler—specifically the flying business traveler.</p>
<p>"About half of car rentals that happen in the U.S. are airport rentals," Chris Brown, executive editor of the trade publication Auto Rental News, says.</p>
<p>Regulatory issues have kept Uber and Lyft out of airports. And Hertz gets better pricing from airport locations because that's where corporate expense-account dollars are spent.</p>
<p>"Uber has certainly eaten into taxi service and also limo service," he says.</p>
<p>But car rentals, he says? Not so much. So it shouldn't have come as a surprise when earlier this summer, Hertz increased airport car-rental fees by $5 a day.</p>

That is the site of the first nuclear plant restart since the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Japan has since mothballed all its nuclear plants, and a lot is riding on operators flipping the switch back on successfully.</p>
<p>Japan’s nuclear plants have put in redundancies since the disaster, like cooling water tanks that only require gravity instead of electricity, and backup power for when the main source goes out.</p>
<p>But until operators fire the plant back up, they can’t be sure the reactor’s key plumbing works, including the pipes and gaskets that handle 200-plus degree water.</p>
<p>“There are things that you can’t test until the plant gets up and running, kind of like a car that’s been idled for awhile or in the shop for awhile,"<span style="line-height: 19.9999809265137px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 19.9999809265137px;">says David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">It’s really when the car goes out on the road that certain things can be tested.”</span></p>
<p>At issue is not just hardware; nuclear safety culture has to restart right as well.</p>
<p>Dale Klein of the University of Texas is a former U.S. regulator and heads a reform panel at Tokyo Electric Power. He says pre-Fukushima, Japanese culture didn’t allow enough questions, such as, “is the tsunami wall high enough?”</p>
<p>“If the safety engineers would have questioned, 'Well, how high should it be? What was our margins? What would you do if one comes in higher than that?’ it would have made things different,” Klein says.</p>
<p>Going forward, Klein says nuclear utility companies have to self-report errors they find and regulators under a new regime that prioritizes safety have to encourage assertiveness.</p>
<p>If the process is bumpy, the Japanese public could question restarts at other plants.</p>
<p>“There’s a list of about 20 that have applied,” says Steven Kraft, senior technical adviser at the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group. “Once you’ve got one that’s OK, it becomes a lot easier to know what to look for going forward.”  </p>
<p>What’s at stake? Japanese proponents want nuclear to grow to 20 percent of its energy mix; it was over 30 percent before Fukushima.</p>
<p>And around the world, some 70 nuclear plants are now being built and would rather avoid more bad news out of Japan.</p>

Time Warner, Disney, Viacom and 21st Century Fox all took a beating in the markets. The fact is that people are canceling their traditional cable subscription plans in droves.</span></p>
<p><span>Marketplace entertainment reporter Adriene Hill says this is something that has been building up for a long time.</span></p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/cord-cutter-or-committed-cable-how-you-watch-what-you-watch" target="_blank">Cord cutters have been cutting cords</a> for a long time," she says.</p>
<p>Disney CEO Bob Iger also drew attention for his claim that he could spin off ESPN into an over-the-top streaming model any time he wanted.</p>
<p><span>"We all have to have our sports, right?" Hill says. "ESPN is part of the reason that we all pay way too much to have a lot of channels that we don’t watch. So when investors heard that ESPN was vulnerable, I think it made them realize just how vulnerable the rest of cable was."</span></p>
<p><span>Now the television industry is in trying to figure out how to make money again. Hill says networks strategies center on producing more quality shows.</span></p>
<p><span>"I guess when you don't know exactly how you're going to make money, all of these networks are trying to make the best television they can to get us there," she says.</span></p>

<p>“You had to block out that time period as if you were working,” he says. One store he worked at was 45 minutes from his house. “We had to be ready to be there on time. With all the regulations about what we wear, how we look and how we present ourselves, I had to get fully ready for my shift and ready to walk out the door at the time I made the phone call to find out if they were even going to need me or not.”</p>
<p>For Miller,  this was more than an inconvenience.</p>
<p>“Having a second job wouldn’t work at a time when I was scheduled for an on-call shift. If they scheduled me for an on-call shift and they didn’t call me, that was real money lost and real time opportunity lost.”</p>
<p>On-call scheduling “means you have to put your life on hold,” says Rachel Laforest, director of the Retail Action Project, a division of the Retail Wholesale and Department Stores Union. “It becomes very difficult to lead full lives, so for example, if I’m a parent and I have to figure out arranging for child care, it’s impossible for me to do that” with such short notice, she says.</p>
<p>There isn’t good national data on the prevalence of on-call scheduling, but regional surveys suggest it’s widespread and not limited to retail, says Stephanie Luce, professor of labor studies at CUNY.  “We see it in fast food, airlines, beauty services,  domestic services, child care services," she says. "<span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">Smaller studies seem to suggest this practice really picked up after the recession, however, over the past couple of years, there’s been a real push back.”</span></p>
<p>After New York’s attorney general suggested Abercrombie and 12 other companies were potentially violating New York law through the practice, Abercrombie announced it would work to discontinue the practice.</p>
<p>The company responded on August fifth “...we understand – and share – the attorney general’s concerns about call-in shift scheduling. The attorney general’s letter helped focus our ongoing internal discussions about how to create a stable and predictable work environment as possible for our employees.”</p>
<p>Gap Inc. told Marketplace: <span style="line-height: 1.42857em;">“Each of our brands have made a commitment to evaluate their practices and determine where we may be able to improve scheduling stability for our employees, while continuing to drive productivity in stores.”</span></p>
<p>Gap also says it’s working on a pilot project with University of California, Hastings College of the Law “to examine workplace scheduling and productivity. Led by recognized expert professor Joan Williams, the goal of the Gap Hourly Scheduling Initiative is to use research and data to create solutions that will be sustainable and can be implemented across our company’s entire footprint and fleet."</p>
<p>Under pressure from a lawsuit, Victoria’s Secret discontinued on-call scheduling earlier this year. </p>
<p>To the extent firms are reconsidering the practice, the reasons are both technological and monetary.  </p>
<p>On-call scheduling resulted from pressure to restrict the ratio of hours to sales and an attempt to more nimbly adapt to changes in demand, says University of Chicago associate professor Susan Lambert. It also results in companies “overhiring,” using many part time workers instead of fewer full time workers.  But Lambert says “the costs of managing this way do not enter the balance sheets of firms.”  Employees who work irregularly, for example, may not always be up to speed with the latest changes to the store or the layout, she says. </p>
<p>“From a very engineering standpoint,...[on-call scheduling]  may look efficient but when you look on front lines of firms, you see all the opportunities costs there are in terms of people walking out because they can’t find something or can’t get help.”  </p>
<p>Another factor is technology. </p>
<p>“New technologies give us now the ability to predict very well variations in demand,” Lambert says.</p>
<p>Companies don’t need to keep workers on hold; they can figure out pretty well whether they need to have someone show up to work far in advance of two hours before the shift starts, she says. Companies are so good at predicting demand that they tried to "overoptimize" down to the minute, keeping workers on call to cover even slight changes in demand.   </p>
<p>“You don’t need to do that micro-management,” she says. “Retailers are learning that."</p>
<p>So it may be, she says, that workers and firms are finding on-call scheduling is a headache for everyone.</p>
<p>Here are the responses from the 13 companies the New York attorney general wrote warnings to:</p>
<ul><li>Ann Inc.: "Staffing guidelines do not include the practice of on-call shifts." </li>
<li>Gap Inc.:  "Each of our brands have made a commitment to evaluate their practices and determine where we may be able to improve scheduling stability for our employees, while continuing to drive productivity in stores.  A<span style="line-height: 1.42em;">s part of our commitment to more sustainable scheduling practices, we are working on a pilot project with Gap Brand and UC Hastings College of Law to examine workplace scheduling and productivity."</span></li>
<li>J.C. Penney Co: "We do not utilize on-call scheduling, and JCPenney has always maintained a policy against the practice."</li>
<li>Sears Holdings Corp: "Sears Holdings does not use on-call scheduling for store associates. That said, we will fully cooperate with the New York Attorney General’s office’s requests."</li>
<li>Target Corp: "Target does not use on-call scheduling."</li>
<li>TJX Cos: "We don’t use on-call shifts at TJX and it hasn’t been our practice, i.e. nothing new since April." </li>
<li>Williams-Sonoma Inc: "We actually discontinued [on-call scheduling] for the entire country."</li>
