        li Over 1000 LA-centric shows
        li Quick and painless tool for producers to find quality content
        li Time-stamped search
      p As they redesigned their website, KCRW needed a better way to leverage evergreen content from LA-centric shows produced over the past two decades. They give Pop Up Archive CSV spreadsheets of past content, which is automatically transcribed with timestamps and tags, and can easily be found, searched, and reused by KCRW staff as they build out new components of their site.

        p Historian Studs Terkel was on the radio every day, five days a week, for 40 years. He talked to everyone: Janis Joplin, Buster Keaton, Martin Luther King Jr., Shel Silverstein. The Library of Congress is digitizing nearly 10,000 hours of Studs Terkel's broadcast interviews, and together with the Chicago History Museum,  WFMT is building a complete digital Studs Terkel archive — but they have no building blocks to use for creating their vision. Pop Up Archive solves that problem quickly and automatically.

        p Illinois Public Media wanted a way to find and reuse evergreen content, and drive more traffic through search engine optimization from transcripts and keywords. They use Pop Up Archive to make their content searchable the same day it is broadcast — both on their website and internally for staff. Pop Up Archive automatically processes their audio, preserves it securely at the Internet Archive, and automatically makes it findable and easily reusable.
