      p The Kitchen Sisters, award winning producers Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, have been creating radio together for NPR and public broadcast since 1979. Over three decades their audio collection has grown to over 5000 recordings — an accidental archive documenting the lives and stories of people, well known and unsung. Their stories chronicle the B-side of history: seldom heard voices, immigrant’s stories, little known histories; the traditions and rituals people carry with them from one country to another, across one generation to the next; the vibrant, changing and fading soundtrack of America.
