					question: "What is Pop Up Archive? Who is it for?",
					answer: "Pop Up Archive is a platform of tools for organizing and searching digital spoken word. We process sound for a wide range of customers, from large archives and universities to media companies, radio stations, and podcast networks: if you’ve got recorded voices, we’ve got you. Drag and drop any audio file (or let us ingest your RSS, SoundCloud, or iTunes feed), and within minutes you’ll receive automatically generated transcripts and tags. By automatically extracting the information from audio, we help radio producers log raw tape, get audio stories online faster, optimize stations’ websites, and ensure that audio and video get indexed by Google for the most innovative digital media properties.",
				},
				{
					question: "How does Pop Up Archive compare to human transcription?",
					answer: "The short answer is that automatic transcription is usually less accurate than human transcription. But getting verbatim human transcripts is expensive, slow and labor-intensive — and search engines don’t need perfect transcripts. There are ways to be smart about interpreting messy output, and to use that data to extract relevant keywords and metadata. It’s like magic: When you pair text content with timestamps, audio becomes browsable. Harnessed the right way, speech-to-text software means effortless access to crucial keywords and moments hidden deep within hours of content.",
				},
				{	
					question: "What does it mean to 'search my sound?'",
					answer: "In addition to our standard search bar, and the search bar for each collection, there is also a search bar for each individual audio item, so you can search for every time a word or phrase is mentioned within a single item."

			title: "Transcripts and Audio Quality",
			link: "transcripts",
			questions: [
				{
					question: "What’s the difference between basic and premium transcripts?", 
					answer: "First, here's all the good stuff you get with both: both basic and premium transcripts use automatic speech recognition software to create time-stamped text and keyword tags based on your audio. Generated in real time (e.g. a hour audio file will be processed in approximately one hour), both types of transcripts allow you to search broadly within your audio collections immediately after automatic processing. Although accuracy varies according to factors like audio quality, with our efficient transcript editing tools, even the most basic transcripts can save hours. Now for the differences: Unlike our basic transcripts, our premium transcripts require only minimal editing to get to publishable quality. These transcripts include significantly improved accuracy, speaker differentiation, punctuation and capitalization. In addition to this, premium transcripts generate more accurate automatic tags. You can use these tags to search for common themes in your collections, or even integrate them as automatic blog tags."
				},
				{
					question: "What languages and accents does Pop Up Archive support?",
					answer: "Pop Up Archive's speech-to-text software currently only supports English language audio. We hope to expand to Spanish language and other major languages in 2015. Because our transcription software is trained on voices from mass media, both Premium and Basic software performs best for dialects heavily represented in American and British broadcast media. That said, feel free to try us out with any accents you've got, and let us know how it goes!",
				},
				{
					question: "Why do the automatic transcripts and tags have errors?",
					answer: "Automatically generated transcripts rely on software to make a guess about what's being said in your audio file. Your transcript will have more or less errors depending on the quality of the audio. For instance, broadcast-quality news productions and interviews recorded with high-quality equipment result in the most accurate transcripts because there is little background noise.",
				},
				{
					question: "What affects transcript quality?",
					answer: "Transcript quality may be adversely affected by the subject speaking quickly, with an accent, or mumbling; multiple speakers speaking at the same time; background noise; or background music tracks. Pop Up Archive also uses keyword extraction tools that pull useful terms from your transcripts, so even if your transcripts aren't perfect, we can still extract valuable information from them.",

			questions: [
				{
					question: "Can I start with a monthly plan, and switch over to an annual plan?",
					answer: "If you start with a monthly plan and decide that you like Pop Up Archive enough to get our discounted annual rate, you can switch to an annual plan anytime. You will be charged the annual rate from the day you switch over. Any remaining time from your monthly plan will be prorated.",
				},
				{
					question: "When and how am I charged?",
					answer: "For monthly plans, you’ll be charged once each month, one the first day of the month. If you sign up mid-month, you'll also be charged a one-time pro-rated fee for the remainder of the month. For annual plans, you’ll be charged once a year on the first day of the month after you signed up. We use Stripe to process payments.",
				},
				{
					question: "What does “hours of processing” mean exactly?",

Each month, you can upload the amount of hours allocated to your plan, and we’ll automatically generate transcripts, tags. You’ll be able to access all your audio on our site as long as you’re a subscriber.",
